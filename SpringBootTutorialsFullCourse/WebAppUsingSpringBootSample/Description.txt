---------------------- Main things to remember

- spring boot doesnt support jsp as a view so
		- in order to do that you need to first download
				- tomcat jasper equal version with your embedded tomcat server
						- check the version of ur tomcat server and download same version of tomcat jasper from mvnrepository
				- after that your spring boot will know how to convert jsp to servlet
