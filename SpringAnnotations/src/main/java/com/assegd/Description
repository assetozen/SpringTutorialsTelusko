--------------------------- main things we learned here are "Spring Core Annotations" -------------------

- Bean creation using
        - AppConfig :- configuration class
- Using Spring Annotations
        - without the need to create beans for them
                - just by simply using @Component in the class
                        - @AutoWired :- where the instance of the class is defined
- @Primary
        - when there is a confusion which instance of the class to create, u can assign primary to the one u want
- @Qualifier
        - when auto wiring u can specify the name of the component u want to autowire
